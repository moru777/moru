        <h1>What is Cybersecurity?</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting internet-connected systems such as hardware, software and data from cyberthreats. It's used by individuals and enterprises to protect against unauthorized access to data centers and other computerized systems.</p>

        <p>An effective cybersecurity strategy can provide a strong security posture against malicious attacks designed to access, alter, delete, destroy or extort an organization's or user's systems and sensitive data. Cybersecurity is also instrumental in preventing attacks designed to disable or disrupt a system's or device's operations.</p>

        <p>An ideal cybersecurity approach should have multiple layers of protection across any potential access point or attack surface. This includes a protective layer for data, software, hardware and connected networks. In addition, all employees within an organization who have access to any of these endpoints should be trained on the proper compliance and security processes. Organizations also use tools such as unified threat management systems as another layer of protection against threats. These tools can detect, isolate and remediate potential threats and notify users if additional action is needed.</p>

        <p>Cyberattacks can disrupt or immobilize their victims through various means, so creating a strong cybersecurity strategy is an integral part of any organization. Organizations should also have a disaster recovery plan in place so they can quickly recover in the event of a successful cyberattack.</p>

        <h2>Why is Cybersecurity Important?</h2>
        <p>With the number of users, devices and programs in the modern enterprise increasing along with the amount of data -- much of which is sensitive or confidential -- cybersecurity is more important than ever. But the volume and sophistication of cyberattackers and attack techniques compound the problem even further.</p>

        <p>Without a proper cybersecurity strategy in place -- and staff properly trained on security best practices -- malicious actors can bring an organization's operations to a screeching halt.</p>

        <h2>Elements of Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p>The cybersecurity field can be broken down into several different sections, the coordination of which within the organization is crucial to the success of a cybersecurity program. These sections include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Application security.</li>
            <li>Information or data security.</li>
            <li>Network security.</li>
            <li>Disaster recovery and business continuity planning.</li>
            <li>Operational security.</li>
            <li>Cloud security.</li>
            <li>Critical infrastructure security.</li>
            <li>Physical security.</li>
            <li>End-user education.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Maintaining cybersecurity in a constantly evolving threat landscape is a challenge for all organizations. Traditional reactive approaches, in which resources were put toward protecting systems against the biggest known threats while lesser-known threats were undefended, are no longer a sufficient tactic. To keep up with changing security risks, a more proactive and adaptive approach is necessary. Several key cybersecurity advisory organizations offer guidance. For example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends adopting continuous monitoring and real-time assessments as part of a risk assessment framework to defend against known and unknown threats.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p>The benefits of implementing and maintaining cybersecurity practices include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Business protection against cyberattacks and data breaches.</li>
            <li>Protection of data and networks.</li>
            <li>Prevention of unauthorized user access.</li>
            <li>Improved recovery time after a breach.</li>
            <li>Protection for end users and endpoint devices.</li>
            <li>Regulatory compliance.</li>
            <li>Business continuity.</li>
            <li>Improved confidence in the company's reputation and trust for developers, partners, customers, stakeholders and employees.</li>
        </ul>
