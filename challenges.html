            <h2>The African Cybersecurity Landscape</h2>
            <p>
                In Africa, the journey toward robust cybersecurity is filled with challenges, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Limited access to cutting-edge tools and resources.</li>
                <li>Insufficient cybersecurity training and awareness.</li>
                <li>High reliance on open-source tools, which may require extensive customization.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Despite these obstacles, we continue to innovate, learn, and build secure systems that 
                rival global standards.
