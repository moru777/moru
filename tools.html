            <p>
                We rely entirely on open-source tools to secure systems and build innovative solutions. 
                Some of the tools we use include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wireshark - For network analysis and troubleshooting.</li>
                <li>Metasploit Framework - For penetration testing.</li>
                <li>Kali Linux - As a comprehensive security toolkit.</li>
                <li>Burp Suite - For web application security testing.</li>
                <li>Autopsy - Open-source tool for digital forensics investigations.</li>
                <li>TheHive - Open-source Security Incident Response Platform (SIRP) for threat intelligence and collaboration.</li>
                <li>Cuckoo Sandbox - Open-source automated malware analysis system.</li>
                <li>OSSEC - Open-source host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) with a focus on cloud security.</li>
                <li>MISP - Open-source Threat Intelligence Platform for sharing, storing, and correlating Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).</li>
                <li>YARA - A tool aimed at malware researchers for creating rules to identify and classify malware.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By using these open-source tools, we demonstrate the power of freely available resources in advancing digital forensics, threat intelligence, malware analysis, and cloud security.

            <h2>Types of Cybersecurity Tools</h2>
            <p>
                Different types of cybersecurity tools are tailored to counter specific threats. Some of the most popular cybersecurity tools are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Firewall Tools:</strong> Used to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules (e.g., pfSense, iptables).</li>
                <li><strong>Antivirus/Antimalware Tools:</strong> Detect and remove viruses and malware from systems (e.g., ClamAV, Sophos).</li>
                <li><strong>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):</strong> Monitor network or system activities for malicious activities (e.g., Snort, Suricata).</li>
                <li><strong>Encryption Tools:</strong> Used to secure sensitive data through encryption (e.g., OpenSSL, VeraCrypt).</li>
                <li><strong>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tools:</strong> Provide real-time analysis of security alerts (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk).</li>
                <li><strong>Network Scanning Tools:</strong> Identify and assess devices and vulnerabilities in a network (e.g., Nmap, Nessus).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Here’s a visual representation of the different types of cybersecurity tools:

                <strong>What are cybersecurity tools?</strong><br>
                Cybersecurity tools help you monitor and fix potential security concerns. These tools are aiding companies and individuals in maintaining their online privacy and security. Cybersecurity tools continuously monitor computer systems or networks and warn the user of potential risks the moment it detects them.
            </p>
            <p>
                They are the ultimate line of defense against various forms of cyber-attacks, such as unsanctioned use of resources, data breaches, and hacker attacks to defend an organization’s system, network, or intellectual property. They also offer protection against cybercrime, such as password trafficking and identity theft.
